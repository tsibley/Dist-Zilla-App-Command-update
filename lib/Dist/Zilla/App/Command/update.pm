=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::App::Command::update - A Dist::Zilla (and hence Dist::Milla)
command to update generated files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ dzil update [--trial]
    $ milla update    # my use case

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command is approximated by

    $ dzil build --no-tgz [--trial]
    $ rm -rf Your-Package-x.yz/

but it builds inside a temporary directory.  If you've ever used C<dzil build
&& dzil clean> to update generated files, now you can use C<dzil update>.
That's all!

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 --trial

Build a trial release, as if C<dzil build> was called with --trial.
